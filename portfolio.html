        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <article>
            <pre style="font-size: medium;">
                Although I was originally born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, I am most definitely a California kid.
                I grew up around the Central Valley, then moved over to the Central Coast shortly after graduating high school in 2015.
                Growing up I had many changing dreams and life goals, but ultimately have found my calling in computer programming and software engineering! 
                Besides coding, I'm also super into video games like Valorant/Call of Duty/Overwatch, as well as music production and playing the drums/piano!

        <pre>
            One of my favorite past prjects is a small E-Commerce applictaion developed with Python and SQL.
            It was a difficult challenge that pushed me and really helped me develop my skills as a programmer and developer.
            The following link leads to my Github repository showing the entire code for this project:
