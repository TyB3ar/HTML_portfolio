This is my submission for the personal portfolio mini project!

It's a very cookie-cutter HTML format document that serves as the skeleton for my personal portfolio.

This document showcases my knowledge and proficieny with HTML, HTML5 semantics, forms, embedding multimedia, and more.

There is a folder attached with all images/multimedia used for this document. 

Thank you!
